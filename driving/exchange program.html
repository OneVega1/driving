                 <h2 style="color: orangered;">Exchange Programs </h2>
                 <p style="text-align: justify;">Unidemy Global facilitates both Student and Faculty Exchange Programs. This follows from our motto of enhancing learning via collaboration. An exchange program will provide the much needed exposure and diversification of perspectives of education platforms all over the world.</p>
                 <h4 class="my-h4s" style="color: black;">The International Student Exchange Program (ISEP)</h4>
                 <p style="text-align: justify;">The ISEP is a unique endeavor to help students achieve one of the most in demand life skills that top universities wish to see in their aspirants – diversity. Culture Shock is the first step to accept diversity. Internationalization of campus promotes peer learning and introduces students to varied perspectives and ideas. The ISEP is a great opportunity for students to get familiar with teaching and learning systems in the USA. </p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-5 about-right"> <img src="img/learning.png" class="img-responsive" alt=""> </div>
           </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
           <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12 left-block" >
                  <p style="text-align: justify;">ISEP promotes ethnic and religious diversity which helps students build tolerance and helps them acquire a key skill of today that helps build connections and influence – Networking. ISEP helps students discover his or her Uniqueness in the Diverse Social Setting.</p>
                 <p style="text-align: justify; ">An exchange student could live with a host family or in a designated place including hostels, affordable apartment/house or student lodge. The cost for each program differs according to countries and institutions. The participants could either apply/receive scholarship, self-funded or apply/receive loan. An exchange student typically stays in the host country for a relatively short period of time, often 6 to 10 months. Some students on exchange programs can receive academic credit from the country they study in. </p>
                 <p style="text-align: justify; ">Unidemy Global conducts a rigorous screening process that selects students for the ISEP:</p>
                 <ul class="privacy-listing" >
                     <li>Academics: An average minimum GPA of 3 over the past 4 years. Transcripts translated into English and a Teacher’s Recommendation</li>
                     <li>English Language Skills: Students must demonstrate acceptable scores on the Standard Tests (TOEFL/IELTS) for English Proficiency and be comfortable in using English conversationally to follow course work and socialize.</li>
                     <li>Personality: A personal essay written by the student to describe his or her personality, hobbies, home life, and above all why they wish to be part of the Exchange Program.</li>
                     <li>Attitude: The ability to deal with the inevitable challenges of adapting to another culture and communicating in a foreign language.</li>
                     <li>Intellectual Curiosity: An open mind toward learning the ins and outs of another culture, such as its social customs, as well as concrete experiences such as food and fun.</li>
                 </ul>
                 
                 <h4 class="my-h4s" style="color: black;">Faculty Exchange Programs</h4>
                 <p style="text-align: justify; ">The faculty exchange programs would provide participants with the opportunity to teach or conduct research for one semester or an academic year at an overseas university. Faculty members would benefit from exposure to a culturally varied and diverse faculty make-up, with an opportunity to exchange ideas and observe a variety of styles. The faculty exchange program is one way to take advantage of the benefits of diverse faculty. The ultimate goal of educational institutions is to develop a vibrant and diverse academic team who are well aware of the challenges of today’s world and what it takes to impart knowledge in today’s dynamic education landscape. </p>
                 <p style="text-align: justify; ">This process, however cannot take place overnight. It occurs slowly: one or two faculty members at a time. The need for rich variety of ideas, cultures, thoughts, and styles, however, is immediate. In order to facilitate the process, foreign universities and local institutions can develop plans for a faculty exchange programs. The benefit will be immediate, and students will have the opportunity to learn concepts and ideas presented in an entirely new and different manner. They will create a greater bond among the concerned institutions and will be a powerful recruitment and retention tool. To ensure that the faculty exchange runs properly, it is important to understand the responsibilities of foreign universities and local institutions.</p>
                 <p style="text-align: justify; ">Three basic schemes may define the nature of the faculty exchange and the responsibilities of the visiting faculty member. Combinations of all three are possible as arranged in each individual case. </p>
                 <ul class="privacy-listing" >
                     <li><span style="color: orangered;">RESEARCH ONLY:-</span> Host institution will arrange housing and visiting faculty member will pay for the cost </li>
                     <li><span style="color: orangered;">TEACHING:-</span> Visiting scholar will be provided with a salary commensurate with teaching load asked for by the host institution and agreed upon by the visitor. Such salary may include the provision of free housing and/or board at no cost to the individual but in any case, host institution will help visitor find housing. The host institution will assign the visiting professor an agreed upon number of courses to teach throughout the semester. If course evaluations are issued, the host institution will forward them to the faculty visitor upon completion of the exchange semester. </li>
                     <li><span style="color: orangered;">GUEST LECTURER:-</span> Visiting scholar will be provided with lecture fees commensurate with the number of lectures asked for by the host institution and agreed upon by the visitor. Such fees may include the provision of free housing and/or board at no cost to the individual but in any case, host institution will help visitor find housing. </li>
                 </ul>
                 <p style="text-align: justify; ">The visiting faculty will be on sabbatical or equivalent leave during the proposed semester of overseas exchange. The exchange will last one semester or one academic year as arranged in advance. Depending on the scheme chosen, the faculty visitor will be responsible for various costs which may include room, board, personal living expenses on site, research costs, etc. Upon completion of the exchange, the visiting professor will submit a summary of his/her experience to the host institution and the home institution.</p>
